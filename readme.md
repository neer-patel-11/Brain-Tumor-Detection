# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect brain tumors from medical images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of over 2000 images and has achieved an accuracy of more than 89%. The CNN model is integrated into a Flask web application, enabling real-time predictions.

## Features
- **CNN Model**: Developed using TensorFlow/Keras with a focus on accurate tumor detection.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied various augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset and improve model performance.
- **Web Application**: Integrated the model with a Flask application for easy accessibility and user interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for model development.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Frameworks used for building and training the CNN model.
- **Flask**: Web framework for integrating the model into a web application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For designing the front-end of the web application.
